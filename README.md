# api-rate-limit-misconfiguration-analysis
Security analysis of API rate limiting misconfiguration validated via Burp Suite, cURL automation, and Python scripting.

This project aims to analyze the rate limiting implementation of an API endpoint and identify potential configuration errors that could lead to API misuse.

Tests are performed both manually and automatically to ensure that the system actually executes requests on the backend.
